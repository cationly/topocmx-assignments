In this 2012 paper, Ringel et al analyse the dependence of the conductivity of
3D weak topological insulator surface states on disorder and the orientation of
the surfaces. They find that the "weak" topological surface states are quite
robust in the presence of disorder that does maintains TR symmetry and does not
close the bulk gap, and that, as a consequence of the inherent
anisotropy of weak TIs, the surfaces' electronic properties strongly depend
on the surface orientation.

The idea that weak TIs are quite robust in the presence of certain types of
disorder is familiar from the lectures, where vacancies in the lattice are
discussed and then dismissed as not particularly interesting.

Disorder on the surface, however, is not really considered in the lecture. One
would think that surface disorder has great potential to absolutely ruin 
topological states hosted at that surface. However, the idea, introduced early
in section II of the paper, that *random* disorder doesn't readily affect the
*topological* protection of a state is intuitively appealing.

The idea of a slanted surface, as seen in Figure 3 (and discussed in section
IV), is something that hadn't occurred to me at least when reading the lecture.
Thanks to the anisotropy of the weak TI, directions in the lattice are
meaningfully (to topology) defined, and a topologically non-trivial surface can
have orientations. In the lectures, only the rectangular case is seen. There,
the surface corresponds to a reciprocal lattice vector of e.g. (100), but
it's also possible that others, such as (201), where [001] is the stacking
direction, can be topological.
